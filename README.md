# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question.)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

- Acccessibility is where you write your code so that the users browser can adjust it according to the needs of the user.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

-1) Using a scaleable font size makes it so that the users browser can adjust the size of the words according to what the users settings are.
2) Use the most semantic tags. it is easy to use div tags everywhere, but using the most semantic tags makes your webpage easy to read by any screenreaders and easy to search on for on the internet.
3) Colors: avoiding colors that color blind people have a hard time differentiating is a big one. and if you do use those colors, such as red and green, use symbols with them to indicate the meaning that you are trying to convey.
BONUS) filling out all ALT tags, this will make it so that any screen readers will be able to know what the picture is, and anyone not using a screenreader will be able to know what the image is if the picture is unable to show up for any reason.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

-A variable is a way to store and use data in code. it can be also be changed, but before i got into that, i would first describe the storing and using data as a legend on a map. the triangles on a map usually indicate mountains, and blue lines indicate rivers and bodies of water. everyone has seen a map in their lives, so it would be easier to comprehend. and once they understood this concept, i would explain how these can also be changed, (on this map, the triangles no longer represent mountains, but campsites... etc.)  

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

-Using a function inside of code is important because it saves us as programmers a lot of time having to write the same equations over and over again. and if we did have to write them countless times, that gives more time to make mistakes. and if we had to change one thing in each of them, it would take even longer. so in all, it just saves us a buttload of time and energy, while also looking clean and efficient.

5. How do you access a key inside of an object inside of an array?

- array-name[index-number].key-name

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.
![alt text](assets/tests_debug_terminal_final.png "your terminal should look like this")

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [ ] Ensure your website is responsive at 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.
